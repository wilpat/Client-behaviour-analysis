# Client Behaviour Analysis
We have a dataset containing the income of clients and their spending scored computed by an organization based on a number of factors (e.g
how frequent they come to the mall, what they buy, their income amongst others)

We are to generate a cluster to better inform the management of this organization the groups of client that come to their mall as
well as what group each of their registered clients belongs to

# File
Open the [Client_behavious_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/wilpat/Client-behaviour-analysis/blob/master/Client_behavious_analysis.ipynb) file to see the notebook

# Tools
I used The KMeans cluster class of the sklearn python package to figure out insights in the given data and create the clusters.
I used the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters to apply in my model
I used matplotlib's scatter plot to help visualize these insights
